# ‚òÄ TSSL Bannerlord Server
TSSL is a dockerized Bannerlord server setup that allows you to quickly deploy a dedicated server. This guide provides instructions for setting up the server manually, as well as automating the build and deployment process using GitHub Actions and Docker.

## üöÄ Get Started

#### üì• Install Docker
 Docker is a platform for creating, deploying, and managing lightweight, portable containers for applications. It simplifies development by packaging code and dependencies into isolated environments that work seamlessly across different systems.

Installation Links:
- [Linux Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) 

#### üîß Build Docker Image
```
docker build -t tssl_bl_srv .
```

#### üöÄ Run Docker Image
```
    docker run -d --name tssl_bl_srv \
    -e TW_TOKEN="Your Taleworld Server Token" \
    -e MODULES="_MODULES_*Native*Multiplayer*_MODULES_" \
    -e TICK_RATE=60 \
    -e SERVER_CFG="server" \
    -p 7210:7210/tcp
    -p 7210:7210/udp
    tssl_bl_srv
```

#### üëâ Note: 

You can use [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) tostreamline the process of building images for to [Docker Hub](https:/hub.docker.com) these images can be deployed to a remote server. 

Workflows actions so far have been **only** **tested** on **Remote Server** with `Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)` installed.

You must have linux with Docker pre-installed on Remote Server and an linux user with permissions to run `docker` command. 
- ! Do not use `root` access. The large part of Linux ecosystem is designed to be run as a limited user, not as root. Running applications as root is very insecure and it can lead you to break your entire system without warning if you're not careful.

## üöÄ Worfklows

![Deploy To Remote Server Deployment Badge](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl_bl_srv/actions/workflows/deploy-instance.yml/badge.svg) ![Build Image to Docker Hub Deployment Badge](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl_bl_srv/actions/workflows/build-image.yml/badge.svg) ![Instance actions on Remote Server Deployment Badge](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl_bl_srv/actions/workflows/instance-actions.yml/badge.svg)

A workflow is a configurable, automated process that runs one or more jobs. Defined by a YAML file in your repository, workflows can be triggered by repository events, manually, or on a defined schedule.

Workflows are stored in the `.github/workflows directory`. A repository can have multiple workflows, each performing tasks, such as:
- Building and Deploying Docker Images
- Control Docker Containers on Remote Server
- Configure by enviornment or in default enviornment

**For more informations please read [Workflow Documentation](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl_bl_srv/blob/main/docs/workflows.md)**

## üîê Github Stored Secrets

Secrets are variables that you create in an organization, repository, or repository environment. The secrets that you create are available to use in GitHub Actions workflows. GitHub Actions can only read a secret if you explicitly include the secret in a workflow.

**For more informations please read [Secrets Documentation](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl_bl_srv/blob/main/docs/secrets.md)**

---

## üìÅ Importing Server Files

Anything **placed** in the `modules/` directory will be copied to the `Modules/` directory in **[Docker Container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)**. This includes custom **scripts**, **assets**, **configurations**, or even **new modules**.

**For more informations please read [Server Files Documentation](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl_bl_srv/blob/main/docs/server-files.md)**
