# ‚òÄ TSSL Bannerlord Server
TSSL is a customizable Bannerlord server setup that allows you to quickly deploy a dedicated server using Docker. This guide provides instructions for setting up the server on both local and remote machines, as well as automating the build and deployment process using GitHub Actions.

---

## üè† Local Server Setup

##### 1. Install Docker
 Docker is a platform for creating, deploying, and managing lightweight, portable containers for applications. It simplifies development by packaging code and dependencies into isolated environments that work seamlessly across different systems.

Installation Links:
- [Linux Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) 

#### 2. Build Docker Image
`docker build -t blsrv .`

#### 3. Run Docker Image
`docker run -d --name tssl_sample_srv -p 7210:7210/tcp -p 7210:7210/udp blsrv`

**Note:** Replace `tssl_sample_srv` with desired container name

## üåê Remote Server Setup (Linux Debian)

##### Install Docker
 Docker is a platform for creating, deploying, and managing lightweight, portable containers for applications. It simplifies development by packaging code and dependencies into isolated environments that work seamlessly across different systems.

Installation Links:
- [Linux Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) 

#### 3. Run Docker Image
`docker run -d --name tssl_sample_srv -p 7210:7210/tcp -p 7210:7210/udp blsrv`

**Note:** Replace `tssl_sample_srv` with desired container name

We recommend to use [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to streamline the process of building images for to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) these images can be deployed to a remote server. 

In order to enable workflow, it is required to setup secrets. To find more informations visit 
`üîê Github Stored Secrets` section.

## üîê Github Stored Secrets

Secrets are stored in [Actions secrets and variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) on GitHub.

In order to enable deployment workflow you need [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account.

**Docker Hub**
- DOCKER_USERNAME `Docker Username for docker repository access`
- DOCKER_PASSWORD `Docker Password for docker repository access`

**Secrets for Deployment (SSH)**
- BL_SRV_TOKEN: `Generated TW token from Console Commands`
- REMOTE_SERVER_IP: `IPv4`
- REMOTE_SERVER_USER `Linux User`
- REMOTE_SSH_KEY `SSH key for Remote Access`

---

## üöÄ Github Actions
- [Build](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl/actions/workflows/deploy.yml) `Manual Execution`
Builds the latest Docker image from the [dockerfile](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl/blob/main/dockerfile) and pushes it to Docker Hub

- [Deploy](https://github.com/vojinpavlovic/tssl/actions/workflows/deploy.yml) `Manual Execution`
Deploys a container on the Training Server (remote server) using the latest image from Docker Hub.
